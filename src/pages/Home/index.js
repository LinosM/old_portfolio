                        A self-motivated full-stack web developer with primarily back-end experience but some front-end as well. Recently earned a certificate in full-stack development from The Coding Boot Camp at UNC-Chapel Hill, with newly developed skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design, as well as strong skills and ability in writing clean and efficient code.

                        With each project, the goal is to improve upon previous ones to ensure a better engaging experience for the end-user. On a recent project, I worked with a team of four to develop a MERN app for users and teams to manage and track various projects and tasks with over 170 personal commits within a month. Iâ€™m hoping to utilize my skill set with a future team to build better experiences on the web.
